  <h1 class="para-header">Want VMF files?</h1>
</div>
<div class="main">
  <p>I've thought about releasing VMF files for my maps/levels for a while, but I never had anyone that would host them, but github pages seems up to the task. Please note: Linux & Mac versions of the games CANNOT open VMFs, and they need to compile. <b>These are not an alternate download.</b> </p>
  <p>If these open in plaintext, hit CTRL+S to save. Make sure that it saves as a VMF. If it doesn't, but saves as HTML, simply change .html to .vmf and it should work</p>
  <h2 id="celltown">gm_celltown</h2>
  <p>gm_celltown had an update a while ago that I am just now giving you access to as a VMF. This update added dynamic lights to certain objects. In the editor, these are <code>env_projectedtexture</code>s, which GMod calls "lamps" ingame.</p>
  <a class="button" href="download/gm_celltown.vmf" download>Download!</a>

  <h2 id="transportation">cp_transportation</h2>
  <p>cp_transportation was never finished. The idea is a TF2 map, but the attacking team (BLU) spawns in a vehicle. If I remember correctly, the layout is completely functional, but had no lighting or decoration, and I decided to scrap it partially because I didn't want to do lighting and partially because I didn't happen to have 32 people who could make sure it was a fun casual match.</p>
<a class="button" href="download/cp_transportation.vmf" download>Download!</a>

<h2>phys_house_medium</h2>
<p>phys_house_medium is a destructible house. It's not small but not big. It's also very hard to run because of dynamic lighting effects, which can be disabled. These are the same <code>env_projectedtexture</code> objects as before, except there are more rendered at once and I think they may be more complex with everything being 100% dynamic.</p>

<h2>gm_beachplease</h2>
<p>gm_beachplease will take longer than most maps to compile, as it uses high-quality shadows that are static. It's also the maximum size and has no fog, yet remains surprisingly performant.</p>
