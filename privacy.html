  <h2>To put it simply: I don't collect any data, but there are a few people involved who could.</h2>
  <p>I have no trackers on this page. No google analytics, no doubleclick, nothing. However, this page is hosted with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, who as far as I know don't do anything to the page, (except new sites will have a filter inserted to avoid people doing anything illegal) but they may collect your IP, which has location info. It refers to your wifi/ethernet network individually, and is unique to it. As far as I know, it's never used for anything other than to serve the right files to the right people, and the info is deleted soon after.</p>
  <h2>What every website gets by default:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your IP</li>
    <li>Location info from IP</li>
    <li>ISP, based on IP</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What is easy for websites to obtain:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Device characteristics, like screen size and density</li>
    <li>UserAgent String, which contains info about your browser, OS, and versions of all</li>
    <li>Through Google or another advertising company, they can get statistics about different users of the site, but Google uses this to build an advertising profile of those involved.</li>
    <li>Google owns an advertising network that collects data about you and a website can place ads in the page for money. This site does not. Google will be quick to tell you that they don't sell your data, which is technically true, they sell ads that track you using their data that they "don't sell", in other words they sell your data.</li>
