<h2>How It Works/TL;DR</h2>
<p>There are two separate web pages; the list, and the post loading page. The list page directs the browser to the post loading page with a link that includes special instructions called a "query string" at the end telling the post loading page what post to show. From here, all the post loading page has to do is take the contents of the post and put it into the body. The title is taken from the filename and the date is actually just part of the post. Also, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stopmotio/JsBlog">here's the code</a> separated from the site.</p>

<h2>The Format</h2>
<p>Most people would expect Markdown. Not here. While I would've liked to incorporate Markdown as an option because I generally prefer its formatting, I ultimately decided against it as adding a Markdown parser myself was beyond my abilities and using an open source one in JavaScript would likely have some legal implications that I don't want to deal with. Instead, the posts are stored as raw HTML files. They include no <code>
&#60;head></code> or <code>&#60;body></code> as they are essentially copy-pasted into the loader page which will include all of the formatting. Essentially, it will behave just like normal text typed directly into the page. This means that, technically, you can <a href="posts/How Chatterbox Works.html">view it raw like any webpage</a> even without JS, although only the text will be viewable.</p>

<h2>Writing a post</h2>
<p>This is more so about how I've set up my dev environment than anything, it doesn't have to be this way, I just like it how it is. I started this on my school Chromebook with the text editor(Caret) on the left side and the browser on the right of that dinky 768p panel. Today I have the same set up on my own PC, but now I use Atom and Firefox. In addition, due to some security features of web browsers, I cannot load the pages directly and have to set up a localhost of some kind. For this, I use Python. All I do is open a command prompt, navigate it to the folder I keep my website files in, run <code>python -m http.server</code> and I'm good to go. Dev environments can vary, but this is how I keep mine and I like it. My current set up means that I can work on anything with a text editor without <code>localhost</code> as long as I'm not writing for Chatterbox, perfect if I want to start coding at school again.</p>
