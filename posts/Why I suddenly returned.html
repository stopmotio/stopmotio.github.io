<p>To understand why I'm back, we must know why I was gone, and to understand that we have to know why this account became active.</p>

<p>I don't exactly remember <em>what</em> I was doing (I believe some stop motion project, but I don't know why I needed GitHub), but at some point in August 2016, this account was created... And then sat completely dormant with zero activity until 2020, the year of pain, when I opened an issue for GMod because I wanted higher limits on objects in the level editor. It then sat dormant until the next year. Activity was also creating issues, until a few months later, when I released <a href="https://github.com/stopmotio/NotepadWeb">Notepad Web</a>. This was because a few months prior I had started a web design class that took up two high school periods at a local career center. I wanted to try my hand at a real project, realer than the other random "websites" I had been making while waiting for the next lesson to begin. (few classes regularly used the whole time)</p>

<p>I had gotten pretty good at CSS after being shown the ropes and generally my projects looked pretty good. However I didn't really get the chance to design for mobile much at all for the entire class so my first projects functioned poorly on mobile, if they were even usable! But eventually I got better and better and better until eventually I was pretty good. I made this site after the first project with scalability in mind, but copied the navbar from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp">this tutorial</a> because I knew I wouldn't be able to make something for mobile. Javascript was still pretty daunting to me at the time but eventually I replaced it because I wanted a better system for phones.</p>

<p>Gradually my thirst for whacky pointless projects waned and I was left with the need to make, but the constraint of something "practical", while everything I wanted to make either would need serverside code or involved complicated things like webGL that I didn't have the inclination to learn because I thought it would be too complicated. Eventually I just stopped making and started playing on my phone. I'd make something occassionally because I needed a tool like it, or because it sounded funny to show to friends, or (in one case) for a school project.</p>

<p>One transfer to a new school later and even a passing interest in this site and my projects was erased by the need to figure out what I was doing and how the school worked. I fell back to games and just sitting on YouTube, because I didn't want to do anything but skip to tommorow and do it all over again.</p>

<p>Eventually I completed Teardown and lost all interest in most of my sandbox games so I decided one day that "hey, remember those ugly buttons you programmed last year? Did you know that it is currently being served live to people?" and just changed them because I didn't have anything else to do.</p>

<p>Will I dissappear again? Probably, yeah. I still don't know what I want to do. But I've always wanted to write stupid little rants like this but because I was on a Chromebook whenever I was working at school I could not test using <code>localhost</code> or compile anything and had to keep it basic. Jekyll requires Ruby, which immediately put it off for me because I couldn't do it at school when I'd actually want to. But times change and here I am at home typing, python http server because this literally doesn't work without it <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server#the_problem_with_testing_local_files" target="_blank">thanks to some security issues</a>. To be honest, I don't know who I'm writing to. I don't think anyone exactly regularly browses my site, and I most certainly am not putting Google Analytics on it(concerns with misc data they may collect without my knowledge) so as far as I know, only I will ever read this. But it's fun to think; maybe one day someone will read this, and, well... I don't know, but it's fun to think about.</p>

<p>If you're not me, then cheers for being here. It would mean a lot to me if I actually knew about it, lol.</p>
